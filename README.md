consume wcfService

This is Web Service client which is consumming the web service   http://119.47.113.13/wcfServer/WcfServiceLibrary.StevenService.svc
By Ajax calling WebMethod of wcfClient application, the wcfClient application passed Employee[] to wcfServer UpdateEmployee(Employee[] emp){...} method.

After that, returning message from Ajax call is displayed as an alert, to inform the updating result.

The UI is decorated with Twitter Bootstrap.

Please post me any good ideas, that I can improve the small project.
